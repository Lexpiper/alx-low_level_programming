# Singly Linked List Project in C Programming

This repository contains a C program that implements a singly linked list data structure. The program allows the user to perform various operations on the linked list, including:

Inserting a new node at the beginning, end, or at a given position in the list
Deleting a node from the beginning, end, or at a given position in the list
Searching for a node with a given value in the list
Displaying the contents of the list
The program is implemented using dynamic memory allocation and provides error handling for memory allocation failures. The user can interact with the program via a simple command-line interface.
