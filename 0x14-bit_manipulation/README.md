# BIT MANIPLATION

Bit manipulation refers to the manipulation of individual bits within a binary data. Bit manipulation is a very useful technique in computer programming and is often used to optimize code and perform low-level operations on data.

In computer programming, we can perform bit manipulation using bitwise operators, such as AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), left-shift (<<), and right-shift (>>).

Bit manipulation can be used for various purposes, such as:

Setting, clearing, or toggling individual bits or groups of bits within a binary number.
Packing multiple values into a single binary number or unpacking values from a binary number.
Checking the state of individual bits or groups of bits within a binary number.
Bit manipulation can be a powerful tool for optimizing code, but it can also be complex and tricky to use correctly. It is important to have a good understanding of binary numbers and bitwise operators before attempting to use bit manipulation techniques in your code.
